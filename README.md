# Mars Colony App
It is a web-based application for Earth colonists exploring Mars using Angular 2, which was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.1.

## Technologies used
### Angular 2
- Implement the Angular 2 Router
- Implement ngForm and validate user input, and prevent forms from sending invalid API requests
- Implement the OnInit Class interface ( different models)
- Implement Components (welcome, register, encounters, report, notfound)

#### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

#### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

#### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

#### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).


### CSS
- Implement a mobile-first responsive layout using Flexbox
- Incorporate styles elements (including SCSS variables and mixins) into a _theme.scss file
- Use Angular Component scope styling and the @import directive
